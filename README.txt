Overview:


Make ILSpy a command line tools for MacOsx ,Linux and any mono supported  platform  base on the ILSpy,
because ILSpy does not work in MacOsx.

It's import from https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy
So thanks to ILSpy Contributors:
	Daniel Grunwald
	David Srbecky
	Ed Harvey
	Siegfried Pammer
	Artur Zgodzinski
	Eusebiu Marcu
	Pent Ploompuu

They did a great work.


Features:

works on command line;
Decompile all dll in the input arguments and generate the project files and solution files just simply by one simple command line.

I like that style instead of a GUI. 

It's better that reading the codes in the IDE than reading it in the ILSpy GUI, more feature help you understand the decompiled codes.

Usage:

	mono ILSpyMac  path/to/all/your/dll  solution_name 

	by aerror.


How to build:

Open the ILSpyMac.sln by MonoDevelop or Xamarin, the click the build button.
